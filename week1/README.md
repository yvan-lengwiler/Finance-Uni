# Week 1: Overview, IT, and a first look at data
This folder contains some files that are helpful for preparation before the semester starts, and for the first class of the semester.

You should have studied the syllabus before.
I will clarify any open admin questions.

I will then provide an overview of the contents we will study.
I will try to gauge your prior knowledge of mathematics, statistics, finance, and programming.

After that, we will go through the installation of `git` on your laptops and create an account on Github.
_Make sure to bring your laptop to class.
You will need root access to it because we install some software.
Also, you need access to the internet (for instance through eduroam).
**Make sure before class that your laptop fulfills these requirements.**_

Finally, we will take a first look at real data.
To that avail, I provide an R script that doenloads some data and perfomrms a simple analysis.
Working with this script will be part of the homework for the 2nd week.
